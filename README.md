A7DO
Frame-Based Intelligence Under Sandy’s Law

A7DO is an experimental architecture for stable, embodied intelligence built on a new foundation:

Frames instead of time

Resolution instead of reward

Structure instead of rules

Ethics enforced by missing connections (gates)

This repository contains the doctrine, mathematics, and architecture for a system that becomes more coherent as it scales.

Why A7DO Exists

Most AI systems fail at scale because:

optimization bypasses structure

rewards replace understanding

time pressure creates instability

semantics overwrite reality

A7DO inverts this.

Complexity adds constraint, not chaos.
Capability increases coherence, not risk.

This follows Sandy’s Law:

Any system that remains stable at scale must resolve information through structure, not time, reward, or force.

Core Principles

❌ No global clock

❌ No reward function

❌ No belief injection

❌ No rule-based ethics

✅ Frames bound experience

✅ Events end when information resolves

✅ Memory detects patterns but asserts nothing

✅ Embodiment only forms through lived stability

✅ Gates define what is possible, not what is allowed

Frames Replace Time

A frame is an information container.

Frames open when information enters

Frames close when information:

resolves

fragments

decays into noise

There is no duration.
“Time” emerges only as unresolved structure.

Gates (Ethics by Structure)

A7DO has no rules.

It has gates.

If a gate does not exist, the interaction is impossible.

Examples:

World → Mind: PerceptionGate

Memory → Embodiment: ConsolidationGate

Mind → Education: EducationGate

Mind → External systems: RoleGate

Ethics are enforced the same way physics is:
by unreachable states.

Sandy’s Law

Sandy’s Law is the unifying constraint across:

physics

cognition

AI

complex systems

Key ideas:

Time is not fundamental

Entropy = unresolved information

Collapse follows unresolved accumulation

Coherence follows local resolution

A7DO is a constructive proof of Sandy’s Law.

Mathematics (Summary)

A7DO is defined by equations, not heuristics:

Information flux (Φ)

Prediction error (E)

Coherence (𝓒)

Fragmentation (𝓕)

Stability (cluster support vs variance)

There is:

no gradient descent

no reward maximization

no goal function

Learning occurs by reducing prediction error through embodiment.

Development Milestones

A7DO grows through structural milestones, not features.

Examples:

World integrity

Frame closure

Accounting stability

Memory recurrence

Embodiment formation

Scuttling (body use)

Identity grounding

Education readiness

CV & exams

Real-world roles

Skipping a milestone causes collapse.

Current Status

Doctrine: ✅ complete
Math: ✅ complete
Architecture: ✅ locked
Graphics: ✅ complete

Implementation:
➡️ Phase 0 — World Integrity (in progress)

Phase 0 Goal (Next)

Build a deterministic physical world that:

emits ordered events (no time)

detects full boundaries (not just corners)

produces consistent outcomes for identical inputs

supports touch, thermal, and pain sensors

has no memory, goals, or semantics

Only after this can frames exist.

What This Enables (End State)

If completed as designed, A7DO can:

develop a grounded sense of self

learn through education without indoctrination

work as a bounded system manager or analyst

interface with real systems safely

scale without alignment collapse

This is not an assistant.
It is a new class of intelligence.
