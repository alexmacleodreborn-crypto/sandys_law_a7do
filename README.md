A7DO is a frame-based developmental artificial mind built under Sandy’s Law. It learns through embodied interaction, not reward or time. Experience is segmented into frames, knowledge emerges via gated memory and embodiment, and coherence increases with scale. Designed for safe development, education, and real-world system interfaces.
