# Embodiment

Embodiment defines grounded, lived invariants acquired through interaction.

This module:
- does NOT think
- does NOT reason
- does NOT infer
- does NOT act

It only defines:
- what may become real
- how stability accumulates
- how identity can ground

Embodiment is written through consolidation only.
