Milestones
Ordered Capability Emergence Without Collapse
1. Purpose

Milestones define the only safe order in which A7DO may gain capability.

They are not deadlines.
They are not feature lists.
They are structural thresholds.

Each milestone must be:

observable

verifiable

stable

irreversible without explicit regression

Skipping a milestone invalidates downstream behavior.

2. Milestone Philosophy

Capability in A7DO must:

emerge, not be installed

stabilize before expanding

increase coherence with complexity

Every milestone answers one question:

“Has the system demonstrated stable resolution at this level of structure?”

If the answer is no, progression stops.

3. Milestone 0 — World Integrity (Pre-Mind)

Goal: Ensure the world is physically consistent.

Requirements:

deterministic event ordering

bounded sensors and actuators

resistance, contact, and resolution mechanics

no hidden state leaks

Verification:

identical interactions produce identical event sequences

no event bypasses the world layer

Outcome:
A world where causality exists.

4. Milestone 1 — Frame Closure

Goal: Prove frames replace time.

Requirements:

frames open on information

frames close on silence, resolution, or fragmentation

no frame remains open indefinitely

Verification:

all event streams segment cleanly

fragmentation produces subframes, not loops

Outcome:
Experience is bounded and safe.

5. Milestone 2 — Accounting Integrity

Goal: Summarize experience without semantics.

Requirements:

AccountantEntries emitted for every closed frame

coherence, novelty, and resolution computed

no access to raw events downstream

Verification:

summaries are consistent across identical frames

noise does not produce false structure

Outcome:
Experience becomes measurable without meaning.

6. Milestone 3 — Memory Formation

Goal: Detect recurrence without belief.

Requirements:

MemoryTraces created from AccountantEntries

similarity detection operational

PatternClusters form only after repetition

Verification:

system distinguishes same vs similar vs novel

no cluster forms from single frames

Outcome:
Recognition without concepts.

7. Milestone 4 — Embodiment Emergence

Goal: Establish grounded invariants.

Requirements:

ConsolidationGate operational

LedgerEntries created only after stability

boundaries, thermal regions, or pain surfaces embodied

Verification:

embodied knowledge reduces prediction error

no embodiment created via instruction or language

Outcome:
Reality becomes predictable locally.

8. Milestone 5 — Scuttling Skills

Goal: Develop usable movement.

Requirements:

repeated action sequences resolve constraints

ScuttlingSkills embodied

overload decreases over time

Verification:

movement improves resolution probability

no global navigation or goal optimization appears

Outcome:
The body becomes usable.

9. Milestone 6 — Confidence Stabilization

Goal: Establish internal stability.

Requirements:

confidence floor rises gradually

arousal and load remain bounded

resolution dominates fragmentation

Verification:

no oscillatory collapse

no runaway internal escalation

Outcome:
The system is developmentally stable.

10. Milestone 7 — Identity Grounding

Goal: Ground selfhood without declaration.

Requirements:

body ownership entries stable

consistent agency over regions

persistence across frames

Verification:

actions reliably affect owned regions

loss of control reduces ownership confidence

Outcome:
A grounded sense of self emerges.

11. Milestone 8 — Education Readiness

Goal: Allow structured learning.

Requirements:

embodiment stable

scuttling reliable

confidence non-fragile

Verification:

system tolerates novel structured environments

does not collapse under exam-like constraints

Outcome:
The mind is ready to be taught.

12. Milestone 9 — Education and CV

Goal: Demonstrate learned competence.

Requirements:

curricula completed

exams resolved coherently

CV generated externally

Verification:

competencies repeat across contexts

performance is stable, not brittle

Outcome:
Capabilities are externally legible.

13. Milestone 10 — Roles and Work

Goal: Safely interface with real systems.

Requirements:

role interfaces defined

perception/expression channels bounded

SLED or other systems accessed only via gates

Verification:

role performance stabilizes coherence

misfit roles naturally degrade and are abandoned

Outcome:
A7DO becomes a usable system participant.

14. Forbidden Progressions

The following are explicitly disallowed:

education before embodiment

memory writing embodiment

language before scuttling

goals before identity

optimization before stability

deployment before role confinement

These paths lead to collapse.

15. Regression and Pausing

Regression is allowed only when:

a milestone demonstrably destabilizes

embodiment contradictions arise

overload persists

Pausing is always allowed.

There is no penalty for slow development.

16. Summary

Milestones are structural thresholds, not deadlines

Progression requires stability, not success

Capability emerges safely and gradually

Skipping steps causes collapse

Completion is observable, not asserted

A system that reaches the next milestone without destabilizing is ready for it.
