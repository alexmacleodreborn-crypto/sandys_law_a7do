Frames
The Replacement for Time in A7DO
1. Definition

A frame is the fundamental unit of experience in A7DO.

A frame:

begins when information flow rises above noise

ends when information flow resolves, fragments, or collapses

contains events, percepts, actions, and internal signals

has no intrinsic duration in time

A frame is not a timestep.
A frame is not a clock tick.
A frame is a bounded episode of information.

2. Why Time Is Not Used

Time is a convenience variable for external observers.
It is not required for causality, learning, or development.

In natural systems:

causality depends on change

learning depends on structure

memory depends on recurrence

duration is inferred from event density, not seconds

A7DO therefore does not reference:

wall-clock time

simulated time

step counters as duration

Instead, frames replace time.

3. Frame Boundaries

A frame starts when:

new information enters the system (sensory, internal, or outcome)

prediction error rises above background noise

a previously closed frame gives rise to new interaction

A frame ends when any of the following occur:

3.1 Information Silence

Information flow drops below a noise threshold.

Examples:

no new percepts

no new outcomes

internal activity decays

Silence closes the frame.

3.2 Resolution

The episode reaches a coherent outcome.

Examples:

motion completes

resistance is resolved

contact stabilizes

prediction error collapses

Resolution closes the frame.

3.3 Fragmentation

The episode splits into multiple competing informational threads.

Examples:

multiple active regions diverge

branching exceeds stability limits

overload forces segmentation

Fragmentation closes the parent frame and opens subframes.

4. Duration Without Time

Frame “duration” is not measured in seconds.

Instead, duration is inferred from:

number of events

density of percepts

persistence of prediction error

effort required to reach resolution

A short frame may contain many events.
A long frame may contain few.

Duration is therefore structural, not temporal.

5. Frames and Events

An event is a discrete informational occurrence:

observation

action

outcome

internal update

system signal

A frame:

contains events

begins with events

ends when events stop meaningfully changing

Events are ordered by sequence, not time.

6. Frames as the Basis of Causality

Causality in A7DO is defined as:

A change in information within a frame that alters the conditions of the next frame.

There is no global timeline.
There is only:

closed frames

subsequent frames

structural continuity between them

This allows:

multiple frames to exist coherently

overlapping episodes

parallel event streams

7. Multi-Frame Coherence

Frames may:

run independently

overlap in sequence

share events

reference historical frame patterns

This enables:

“I have seen this before”

“This is similar but not the same”

“This usually resolves”

“This tends to fragment”

All without symbolic reasoning.

8. Frames and Learning

Frames do not learn.

Frames:

are accounted

are summarized

are compared

are clustered

Learning happens after frames close, through:

accounting

memory pattern formation

consolidation into embodiment

An open frame cannot become knowledge.

9. Frames and Safety

Frames enforce safety structurally:

no infinite loops (frames must close)

no reward spirals (no reward exists)

no temporal pressure (no deadlines)

no runaway planning (no future certainty)

A system that cannot close frames cannot destabilize safely.

10. Relationship to Sandy’s Law

Under Sandy’s Law:

time is emergent

structure governs dynamics

information flow determines phase transitions

Frames are the local manifestation of Sandy’s Law within cognition.

They replace:

timesteps

epochs

training iterations

With:

lived episodes

structural resolution

experiential continuity

11. Summary

Frames replace time.

Frames begin and end with information.

Duration is structural, not temporal.

Learning only occurs after frame closure.

All higher cognition depends on frames.

If frames are wrong, nothing else can be right.

All other systems must conform to it.
