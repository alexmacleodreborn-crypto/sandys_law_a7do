Scuttling
Body Development Through Lived Interaction
1. Definition

Scuttling is the process by which A7DO develops and learns to use a body.

Scuttling is:

developmental

local

experiential

grounded in movement and resistance

Scuttling is not:

path planning

navigation optimization

pre-defined locomotion

symbolic control

A7DO does not begin with limbs or skills.
It begins with raw actuation potential.

2. Why Scuttling Comes After Embodiment

Before scuttling:

the body has no stable map

regions are not yet “owned”

boundaries are unknown

overload is undifferentiated

Embodiment provides:

body regions

boundaries

pain surfaces

thermal regions

Scuttling uses these invariants to form coordinated movement.

3. The Body as a Developing Structure

The body in A7DO is not predefined as “legs”, “arms”, or “directions”.

Instead, the body begins as:

regions (front, back, left, right)

actuation channels

sensor responses

Scuttling discovers:

which actions affect which regions

which regions move together

which movements resolve constraints

Limbs are emergent, not declared.

4. Scuttling Episodes

A scuttling episode is a sequence of frames in which:

actions are attempted

resistance is encountered

resolution is sought

Scuttling episodes often involve:

repeated contact

pressure feedback

blocked motion

redirection

Episodes close via normal frame closure:

resolution

fragmentation

overload

silence

5. Learning Through Resolution

Scuttling does not optimize reward.

Learning occurs when:

a sequence of actions

consistently leads to resolution

with manageable load

and stable coherence

These sequences are detected by Memory and proposed as Scuttling Skills for Embodiment.

6. Scuttling Skills

A Scuttling Skill is an embodied movement pattern that:

reliably resolves a class of constraints

reduces prediction error

avoids overload

stabilizes frames

Examples:

backing away from resistance

turning to follow a boundary

alternating region activation

sliding along surfaces

Skills are conditional:

they apply only under similar contexts

they may fail in novel situations

7. No Global Navigation

A7DO does not build a global map during scuttling.

There is:

no coordinate system

no path graph

no destination planning

Instead:

movement is local

decisions are reactive

coherence is prioritized over efficiency

This prevents brittle behavior.

8. Relationship to Pain and Load

Pain surfaces and overload signals act as local constraints, not punishments.

Scuttling adapts by:

reducing effort

changing direction

shortening action sequences

increasing exploratory variation

Pain guides structure formation without enforcing avoidance behavior globally.

9. Scuttling and Confidence

Confidence increases when:

scuttling skills lead to resolution

frames close cleanly

overload is avoided

Confidence does not increase because of success alone.
It increases because the world becomes predictable.

10. Scuttling and Identity

Repeated scuttling establishes:

which regions are controllable

which actions are “mine”

which movements belong to the body

This grounds bodily identity without naming it.

11. Safety Properties

Because scuttling:

is local

is experiential

has no reward optimization

has no global planning

A7DO cannot:

seek extreme actions

optimize itself into instability

generalize unsafe movement

Exploration remains bounded.

12. Relationship to Sandy’s Law

Under Sandy’s Law:

structure emerges through repeated resolution

stability forms from constrained dynamics

Scuttling is Sandy’s Law applied to movement.

13. Summary

Scuttling develops the body through interaction

Limbs and skills emerge, not preexist

Learning happens through resolution, not reward

Movement remains local and safe

Identity and confidence deepen through action

Scuttling is how the body learns to exist.
